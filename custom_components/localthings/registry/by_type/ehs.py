"""EHS (Eco Heating System) air-to-water heat pump device registry
(Samsung TP1X_DA_AC_EHS-class).

Shares the DA_AC_ board prefix with the room-AC family in
airconditioner.py, but its /mode/*/vs/0 and /temperatures/*/vs/0 resources
are its own shape (two independent loops: zone1 space heating/cooling and
dhw domestic hot water), not airconditioner.py's HREF_MODE/HREF_TEMP* OCF
pattern -- so nothing from that module is reused here except MUTE_ONCE,
whose /option/muteonce/vs/0 field shape (`muteonce`) is identical on this
family's dump.

# Options-flow key (entry.options, not entry.data): lets a user override the

# writes (e.g. default detergent/softener dosing on a washer, applied even
# to the built-in programs) -- the block exists to give a clear error
# instead of a silent device-side rejection, but that assumption doesn't

# remaining drifts by the poll interval between those revisions -- both push
# a fresh state (and a recorder/logbook entry) far more often than the
# estimate is meaningfully different. 0 disables the gate (every computed

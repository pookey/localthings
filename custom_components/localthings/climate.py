"""Climate platform for Local Things.

The first composite entity in this integration: a single HA climate card that
unifies several OCF resources of a Samsung air conditioner. Unlike every other
platform here (one descriptor -> one resource field), a climate entity reads
power, HVAC mode, current/target temperature, fan (wind) strength, swing (wind
direction) and the convenient-mode preset from *different* resources.

It binds one primary `BoundEntity` (the `/mode/vs/0` capability) so the registry
still tracks it, and reads the sibling resources straight from the coordinator
snapshot via `coordinator.resource(href)` -- the same cross-resource read that
`number.py` (live range/unit) and `select.py` (options callable) already do.

Writes go through `coordinator.async_send_command(bound, (kind, value))`: the
CLIMATE capability's `write_fn` maps each `(kind, value)` payload to the right
`(path_segs, body)`, and `async_send_command` POSTs to those path_segs and
applies the optimistic value/settle guard to that same href -- not the bound
`/mode/vs/0` href -- so one descriptor drives writes to, and gets fresh state
back for, power, mode, temperature and wind resources alike.

Two device families are served here, by two entity classes:
`LocalThingsClimate` for the room air conditioner, and
`LocalThingsEhsZoneClimate` for the space-heating zone of an EHS air-to-water
heat pump. Unlike fan.py, which tells its three classes apart by bound href,
these two cannot be -- both families bind `/mode/vs/0`
(`airconditioner.HREF_MODE == ehs.HREF_ZONE_MODE`). They are dispatched on the
descriptor type instead, which is the entire reason `EhsZoneClimateDesc`
exists as a subclass of `ClimateDesc`.

    """Composite climate entity for a Samsung EHS space-heating zone (zone1).

    Structurally this is water_heater.py's LocalThingsWaterHeater with HVAC
    modes in place of operation modes: it binds `/mode/vs/0` as its primary
    resource and reads `/power/vs/0` and `/temperatures/indoor/vs/0` off the
    coordinator snapshot, writing back to all three through the ZONE
    capability's `write_fn` (ehs._zone_write).

    Two things about the temperature it exposes are worth stating plainly,
    because a climate card implies room-thermostat semantics that this loop
    does not have:

    * It is a *leaving-water* (flow) setpoint, not a room setpoint --
      `/temperatures/indoor/vs/0` reports `type: Water`, `desired` is the
      water the unit aims to send out, and `current` is what it is actually
      sending. Modelling that as a climate entity is the settled HA
      convention for air-to-water heat pumps, but "current temperature" here
      is not the temperature of any room.
    * When the unit is running on the water law (weather compensation) the
      curve computes the flow setpoint and `desired` no longer decides it;
      the user-facing adjustment is then the water-law offset. So the number
      on this card can differ from what the unit is really targeting. That
      was equally true of the `zone_target_temperature` number this entity
      replaces -- it is a property of the device, not of the entity.

    min/max also track the *current* mode (the unit reports FSV #1011/#1012's
    cooling range in Cool and #1031/#1032's heating range in Heat), which is
    why they are read live from the rep on every access. A consequence: right
    after a Heat<->Cool switch, and before the next poll lands, the target
    temperature can sit outside [min_temp, max_temp].

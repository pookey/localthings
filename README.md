# LocalThings

**A native Home Assistant custom integration for local control of newer-generation Samsung connected appliances.** No cloud round-trip. Add a device through HA's normal *Settings > Devices & Services* flow and it talks CoAP-over-DTLS straight to the appliance on your LAN.

This integration uses the [`smartthings-local`](https://github.com/QuiteYellow/SmartThings-Local) library to handle the low-level DTLS/CoAP communication with devices.

### What you get

Adding a device just needs a host IP and your CA credentials in the UI. The integration reads the appliance's identity and picks the matching capability registry on its own, so there's no per-model descriptor to write for a new unit of a type that's already supported.

Credential setup is one-time. The first device you add asks for a CA certificate and key (see Part 2); every device after that reuses the same stored CA and only asks for the host IP, minting its own per-device leaf cert automatically.

Your state stays on your LAN: HA talks to the appliance over a direct DTLS session, and Samsung's cloud sees nothing from this integration. (The appliance itself still maintains its own connection to Samsung; that's firmware behavior on the device side, not something this integration controls.)

### Supported appliance types

| Type | Registry |
|---|---|
| Air conditioner | `by_type/airconditioner.py` |
| Air purifier | `by_type/air_purifier.py` |
| Dehumidifier | `by_type/dehumidifier.py` |
| Dryer | `by_type/dryer.py` |
| Oven | `by_type/oven.py` |
| Microwave | `by_type/microwave.py` |
| Gas cooktop (read-only burner status) | `by_type/cooktop.py` |
| Range hood | `by_type/range_hood.py` |
| Range | `by_type/range.py` |
| Dishwasher | `by_type/dishwasher.py` |
| Refrigerator | `by_type/refrigerator.py` |
| Washer | `by_type/washer.py` |
| Water purifier | `by_type/water_purifier.py` |
| Vacuum clean/auto-empty station | `by_type/vacuum_station.py` |
| Air dresser | `by_type/air_dresser.py` |

Each registry composes shared and family-specific `Capability` objects from `registry/capabilities/`; those modules document the individual resources/entities in more depth than a README table can stay current with.

Other Tizen RT / DAWIT-family appliances almost certainly speak the same protocol underneath, since the auth path and CoAP primitives are shared across the fleet. Adding a new type means writing a new `by_type/<name>.py` registry file; it doesn't require reverse-engineering the protocol again. See **Adding a new appliance type** below.

---

## Part 1: Is your appliance compatible?

```sh
# UDP scan for DTLS-CoAP ports
nmap -Pn -sU -p 49152-49160 "$APPLIANCE_IP"
```

- Any UDP port in `49152-49160` open|filtered with a DTLS handshake responding: newer firmware (Tizen RT 3.x, DAWIT 3.0+). This is what the integration talks to. Most devices answer on `49154`/`49155`, but some builds bind lower (e.g. `49153`). The config flow sweeps the whole range and auto-detects the live port, so you don't need to know which one your device uses.
- Only `8888/tcp` open (token-based HTTPS): older firmware (roughly 2018-2022). **Not supported here.**

---

## Part 2: One-time setup, get the AC14K_M CA credentials

The config flow (Part 3) needs a **CA certificate and CA private key** to mint each device's leaf cert itself. Specifically, it needs the `AC14K_M` intermediate CA — a cert chain that's been public for years and still ships in current Samsung firmware trust stores. Every Samsung Tizen/RT-OCF appliance trusts identities chained to that CA with full access by default, so a cert signed by it is what lets HA talk to your appliance without Samsung's cloud in the loop. HA doesn't need the *device's* original cert or key, only something `AC14K_M` has signed, and it mints that itself once you give it the CA.

This repo doesn't include the needed CA bundle. For an example of how to obtain it, including fetching the AC14K_M cert and key and verifying they pair, see the `smartthings-local` protocol project's [`setup_cert.py`](https://github.com/QuiteYellow/SmartThings-Local/blob/main/setup_cert.py). However you obtain the CA cert and key, paste their PEM contents into the HA config flow's "CA Certificate (PEM)" and "CA Private Key (PEM)" fields in Part 3. You only need to do this once, since every appliance you add afterward reuses the same stored CA.

---

## Part 3: Add the integration in Home Assistant

1. Copy `custom_components/localthings/` into your HA config's `custom_components/` directory. (Or add this repo as a custom repository in HACS — `Integration` category — and install it from there.)
2. Restart HA.
3. **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > LocalThings.**
4. First device: paste the appliance's IP, plus the contents of the CA private and public key from Part 2.
5. The flow fetches the current UUID from Samsung's cloud gateway, mints a leaf cert signed by your CA, sweeps the `49152-49160` range to find the live DTLS port, and confirms the device answers `/device/0`. On success it creates the config entry and detects the device type automatically.
6. Every subsequent device only asks for the host IP; the stored CA credentials are reused to mint that device's leaf cert.

Entities appear under one HA device per appliance, named `Samsung Appliance (<ip>)` initially. Rename freely: the config entry is keyed on the device's serial, not the name.

---

## Part 4: Per-device settings

Each device has its own **Configure** option in Settings > Devices & Services, under **Device settings**:

- **Allow writes even when remote control is reported off** — by default, LocalThings blocks every write with a clear error whenever a device reports remote control off, rather than letting the device silently reject it. Some devices accept certain writes anyway (e.g. default detergent/softener dosing on a washer) even while reporting remote control off. Only enable this if you've confirmed writes actually work on your device with remote control off — otherwise you trade a clear error for a silent failure.
- **Estimated finish -- minimum change (minutes)** — a washer/dryer/dishwasher's `finish_time` sensor is recomputed from the device's own remaining-time estimate on every poll, which commonly drifts or gets revised by a minute or two between updates. This setting holds `finish_time` at its last reported value until a new estimate differs by at least this many minutes, cutting down on Home Assistant history/logbook noise from a value that hasn't meaningfully changed. Defaults to `3`; set it to `0` to report every computed change.

---

## Development

### Docker Compose dev environment

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

The `Dockerfile` builds on the official `home-assistant/home-assistant:stable` image and pre-installs `smartthings-local`, so the dependency is present at container start instead of depending on HA's own runtime pip-install step. Re-run with `--build` whenever the pinned `smartthings-local` version changes.

`docker-compose.yml` sets `network_mode: host`, which is required since DTLS is UDP and won't traverse Docker's bridge NAT to reach LAN appliances, and bind-mounts `custom_components/localthings/` read-only into `ha_config/custom_components/`. Bump `custom_components.localthings` to `debug` in `ha_config/configuration.yaml` for verbose protocol logging.

### Tests

```sh
python3.13 -m venv .venv          # 3.13 or newer; see below
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -q
```

`requirements-dev.txt` already pulls in Home Assistant and pytest at matching versions, so there's nothing to install alongside it. Use Python 3.13 or newer: pip resolves the newest `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` your interpreter supports, and on 3.12 or older nothing resolves and the install fails outright. CI runs 3.14.

A large suite covering registry composition, discovery, entity descriptors, and golden-file regression against captured device dumps. `requirements-dev.txt` pins `smartthings-local` the same way `manifest.json` does, so tests exercise the real published protocol layer rather than a vendored copy.

## Reporting a capability gap

If your appliance's type isn't recognized, or it exposes resources this integration doesn't model yet, a Repairs
issue appears under Settings > System > Repairs pointing you at Settings > Devices & Services > this device >
the menu > Download diagnostics. That download is already redacted of account/network identifiers (Bixby login
email, access tokens, device IDs, MAC addresses, serial numbers) before it's generated, so it's safe to attach
directly to a new issue using the linked device-support template. This is the fastest way to help add or expand
support for hardware the maintainers don't have.

---

## Adding a new appliance type

1. Get a capture of the appliance's `/device/0` response. The easiest way: add the device to HA (type detection failing is fine) and pull its Diagnostics download from Settings > Devices & Services > the device > the menu > Download diagnostics — it already contains a redacted dump of the device's resources.
2. Reuse existing `Capability` objects from `registry/capabilities/` wherever the resource matches one already declared. Most `common.py` capabilities (power, kids lock, remote control, alarms, energy/water meters) are shared verbatim across families; add new ones only for resources unique to the new type.
3. Create `registry/by_type/<name>.py` with a `DeviceRegistry(name=..., capabilities=_build([...]))`. Use `pattern_capabilities` instead of `capabilities` for any resource whose `href` isn't fixed (for example per-compartment fridge resources); see `refrigerator.py` for the pattern.
4. Register it in `_REGISTRY_BY_KEY` in `registry/by_type/__init__.py`, then route devices to it by adding the board-family token from their `modelNum` to `_BOARD_TOKEN_TO_KEY` — a single row, e.g. `'VSKR': 'vacuum_station'`. Tokens are matched whole (the model string is upper-cased and split on any run of non-alphanumerics), so one entry covers every delimiter spelling Samsung uses: `TP1X_DA-AC-RAC-01001` and `TP2X_RAC_20K` both resolve on `RAC`. Name the specific type, never the board family that contains it — `DA-AC-` prefixes RAC/WAC/DHM/AIR alike, so a bare `AC` row would swallow the dehumidifier and the air purifier. If the board is shared across types (washers and dryers both report `DA_WM_`), add the consumer-model prefix from `description` to `_CONSUMER_PREFIX_TO_KEY` instead. If the device omits `/information/vs/0` entirely (as the verified NA9300K cooktop does), add a distinctive, conservative resource-signature rule to `for_device_by_resources()`.

   `oneUiVersion` is deliberately not consulted — see `resolve()` in that file for why.
5. Add golden-file coverage in `tests/` against a captured `/device/0` dump for the new type.

No config-flow changes are needed. Device-type detection and entity wiring are fully driven by the registry.

## Known device behavior

Samsung's firmware occasionally drops the DTLS session briefly — this is normal appliance-side behavior, not a bug. The integration reconnects automatically, and from HA's perspective a brief reconnect looks like an entity holding its last value for one poll cycle rather than going `unavailable`. When an appliance supports it, the integration prefers push-based updates (instant, via `observe.py`) over polling, falling back to polling otherwise.

If reconnects become persistent (more than a handful per minute), something's actually wrong. Check the appliance's Wi-Fi link first, then look for a competing DTLS client on the LAN — only one active session per appliance is allowed at a time.

### Multi-subdevice ("2-in-1") air conditioner systems

Some Samsung installs run more than one indoor subdevice off a single outdoor unit, all reachable over the *one* IP/DTLS session your config entry connects to (a floor-standing + wall-mounted 2-in-1 is a common shape). The integration discovers any sibling subdevices automatically, once, right after the first successful poll — there's nothing to configure. Each discovered subdevice gets its own HA device (linked to the main one via "via device") and its own `climate` card, so it lands in its own room in the dashboard instead of being invisible or mixed into the master's state.

Two on-the-wire shapes are supported, both keyed off what the appliance itself reports:

- **Indexed siblings** — the device answers a `/device/1`, `/device/2`, ... collection alongside its own `/device/0`, mirroring every resource at that index.
- **UUID-prefixed tree** — the device reports a sibling's id in `x.com.samsung.da.subdeviceIdList`, and that id doubles as a literal href prefix for the sibling's own resource tree.

A candidate that answers but never produces any real, user-facing state (an unused slot some installs report alongside a genuine second subdevice) is silently skipped rather than turned into a phantom entity — check diagnostics' `subdevices`/`subdevices_skipped` blocks if a subdevice you expect to see isn't showing up, and file an issue with that diagnostics download attached.

## Contributing

Patches are welcome, especially:

- New `by_type/` registries for appliance families not yet covered (AC, microwave, etc.) on the same Tizen RT 3.x firmware family.
- Confirmation or refutation of compatibility on additional models within an already-supported type.
- Protocol-level fixes, which belong upstream in [`smartthings-local`](https://github.com/QuiteYellow/SmartThings-Local) rather than here. HA-side fixes (entities, config flow, coordinator, registry) belong in this repo.

If you submit a PR, please don't include real device UUIDs, MACs, serials, IPs, or CA private key material. Use the placeholders from the config-flow form instead.
